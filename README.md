# Lead-Scoring-Model
Problem Statement- The company 'X Education' is facing a problem of low conversion of leads to customers, the rate of conversion being around 30%. To counter this situation, the company wishes to identify the leads most likely to be converted, so that the sales team can focus their attention on them and get as many conversions out of that pool as possible.
